            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>Im Nipun , just trying to build my first project.</p>
            <p>THE idea is to make a platform where you can get your resume reviewed by AI and get feedback on your resume.
              I am trying to make this project as simple as possible and make it as user friendly as possible.
              Firstly the user will have to login and then they will be able to use the platform.
              The user will have to upload their resume and then the AI will review the resume and give feedback on it.
              The Ai will ask questions and the user will have to answer them.
              The user will be able to see the feedback and then they will be able to download the resume with the feedback.
              this is how the interview process will work. the timer will be set for 10 seconds and the user will have to answer the question within the time.
              the user will be able to see the question and the answer and the feedback will be given by the AI.after finishing the interview the user will be able to download the resume with the feedback.
            you will also get the score of the interview and the feedback will be given by the AI.
